# Welcome

Welcome to Things I Wish I Had Known About College (or just Wish I Had Known). The focus of this project is the google doc that's linked at the top of the page. However, in order to ensure the long term stability of this project, I created this website. **Visit this website for the most updated links**

## Make a branch

Because this is a project with a very broad focus, there may be some disagreement. If you feel like there needs to be a significant change to the doc which has not been addressed as a suggestion, you can [make a copy of the doc](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/49114?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en#zippy=%2Cmake-a-copy-of-a-file). If you want it to be posted again here see the section on suggestions/merging.
